The purpose of this project is to do data analysis of 311 Phone number dataset of the zip code 10025. For the Top10 file, we found the the top 10 reasons for calling 311 during 2020 in this zip code, and ranked them in a descending order. For the Parking file, we analyzed that illegal parking is not a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in 10025 than they are in general.
